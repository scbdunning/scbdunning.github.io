## Dissertation: Roman Ludi Saeculares from the Republic to Empire

Religious rituals provide a key to our interpretation of the events and developments that transformed ancient Roman society. Many of these rites had their origins in a legendary past, and were reshaped in response to socio-political crises and upheavals in the Republic and Empire. The Ludi Saeculares (Secular Games) are a primary example of such a metamorphosis. Ancient traditions held that these Games were performed roughly once every century from their mythic founding in the sixth century BCE until their final celebration in 248 CE. Succeeding generations altered the character of the Games dramatically: a ritual once performed by the Valerian clan as a private act of propitiation to chthonic deities became a public celebration of Rome’s prosperity under the emperors. A study of the Secular Games will bring to light the religious frameworks and political attitudes that lay beneath this radical change.

Despite the importance of the Secular Games to the study of Roman religion, there is a great need for more comprehensive research on the tradition of the Games. Much of the most outstanding scholarship on the subject predates advances in our understanding of the religions and early history of Rome, and more recent works concentrate solely on the Augustan Games of 17 BCE. At the same time, the primary sources for the topic are ripe for reassessment, now that Schnegg-Köhler’s collection of sources relating to the Games with a commentary (2002) has replaced the once-standard work of Pighi (1965). 

I am directing my doctoral research toward significant gaps in scholarship on the Secular Games, specifically: how the Games gradually evolved from rituals traditionally associated with the private religious practices of the Valerii; how changes to the ritual reflect contemporary religious and socio-political concerns in each century, especially in debates over the influence of “Augustan ideology” in the Games of 17 BCE; how Romans perceived their religious tradition across different eras; and how the use of the term *saeculum* on imperial coinages and inscriptions of the second and third centuries became an important tool for defining and presenting emperors’ public images and ideals for their regimes, even in years in which Ludi Saeculares were not held. I utilize a variety of ancient sources, including Zosimus, Censorinus, Livy, the *Res Gestae* of Augustus, coins, and invaluable inscriptions detailing the events of the Games of 17 BCE and 204 CE. My dissertation is divided into five chapters examining the Republican origins of the Games, the Augustan celebration, the Games of Domitian and of Septimius Severus, and the end of the Ludi Saeculares in the third century CE.
