## Introductory Latin II

### University of Toronto, Winter 2015

## Introduction to Classical Mythology

### [Syllabus]({{ site.url }}/pdfs/cla204-intro-to-classical-myth.pdf) | University of Toronto, Summer 2014

This course will provide you with an introduction to the most important myths from the ancient Greek and Roman civilizations. We will focus especially on myths in action: how myths were transmitted, performed, and changed over time, and the role that these myths played in shaping the societies that had created and adapted them. There will also be an introduction to the reception of Classical myths in later Western cultures. All course readings come directly from translations of ancient texts and will be available online through our Perseids website. We will also examine myths narrated through other media, such as vase paintings, sculptures, frescoes, etc. For your last assignment, you have the option of comparing an ancient object at the [Royal Ontario Museum](http://www.rom.on.ca/) to a literary version of a myth from your assigned readings. The instructor will offer an optional tour of the Greek and Roman collections at the ROM to help you select an object for your discussion.

## Introductory Ancient Greek II

### [Syllabus]({{ site.url }}/pdfs/grk102-intro-to-greek-ii.pdf) | University of Toronto, 2014

This course forms the second half of an intensive introduction to Classical Greek, in which you will continue to develop and master a foundational knowledge of Greek grammar, syntax, and vocabulary. We will cover Units 8–14 of our textbook, Hansen and Quinn. In addition, you will continue to improve your translation skills with short passages from Greek to English in different genres (including histories, tragedies, philosophical works, and inscriptions), and translations from English to Greek at sight. 

## Religion in the Roman World

### [Syllabus]({{ site.url }}/pdfs/cla310-religion-in-the-roman-world.pdf) | University of Toronto, 2012

This course is designed for students with some knowledge of the Greco-Roman civilizations, and will provide you with an introduction the study of the most important religious traditions, practices, beliefs, and attitudes in the Roman world from the eight century BCE to the fourth century CE. We will consider a variety of primary sources in translation (inscriptions, literation, coins, calendars, art, architecture, etc.) that contribute to our understanding of religion in the Roman world, in order to apply basic methods of religious studies and historiography to the study of ancient material. We will examine the many forms of religion in the city of Rome and the provinces, including traditional polytheistic practices, Mithraism, Isis cults, Judaism, and Christianity.

The instructor will offer an optional tour of the Roman collections at the [Royal Ontario Museum](http://www.rom.on.ca/), highlighting objects of particular interest in the study of ancient religion.

## Introduction to Roman History

### [Syllabus]({{ site.url }}/pdfs/cla231-intro-to-roman-history.pdf) | University of Toronto at Mississauga, 2012

This course is designed for students with little or no previous study of Roman civilization or history in general. We will examine over one thousand years of Roman history, from the city’s prehistoric foundations to the Empire of the fourth century CE. The point of this course is not simply to memorize lists of names and dates; rather, we will pay close attention to methodological problems in the study of history, ancient and modern. We will consider a variety of primary sources (in translation) that contribute to our understanding of the Roman world, while discussing the issues that historians face in reconstructing models of the past.

## Introductory Latin I

### [Syllabus]({{ site.url }}/pdfs/lat101-intro-to-latin-i.pdf) | University of Toronto, 2011

We will cover Chapters 1–22 in our textbook, Wheelock's.
