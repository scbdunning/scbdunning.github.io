## Religion in the Greek World

### University of Toronto, Winter 2016

This course is designed for students with some knowledge of the Greco-Roman civilizations, but with little or no previous study of Greek religions or other religions in the ancient Mediterranean. We will examine religious expressions, beliefs, and forms of worship in the Greek world from the Mycenaean period to the fourth century CE, including Greek polytheistic traditions, Judaism, and Christianity. The point of this course is not simply to memorize lists of gods and temples; rather, we will pay close attention to methodological problems in the study of ancient religions and cultures. We will consider a variety of primary sources (in translation), and students will have the opportunity to write a research paper on any subject relating to the course material.

The instructor will offer an optional tour of the Greek collections at the [Royal Ontario Museum](http://www.rom.on.ca/), highlighting objects of particular interest in the study of ancient religion.

## Topics in Classics: Greek and Roman Drama and Theatre

### University of Toronto at Mississauga, Winter 2016

This course is designed for students with some knowledge of Greco-Roman civilizations and literature, but with little or no previous study of Greek and Roman theatre. We will read and examine a number of classical plays in translation, both tragedies and comedies, including the works of Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes, Menander, Plautus, Terence, and Seneca. The point of this course is not simply to memorize lists of characters or plot twists; rather, we will pay close attention to methodological problems in the study of classical theatre from both historical and literary perspectives, emphasizing details of their performance (staging, music, masks and costumes, theatres and audiences, etc.), literary analysis, dramatic structures, and socio-political contexts.

## Introduction to Classical Studies

### [Syllabus](/pdfs/cla160-intro-to-classical-studies.pdf) | University of Toronto, Summer 2015

This course will provide you with an introduction to ancient Greek and Roman civilizations from approximately 2000 BCE–4th century CE. We will study many facets of the ancient world, including literature, philosophy, art, theatre, politics, oratory, myth and religion, scientific and military developments. You will learn the basic methods and problems that classicists face in reconstructing models of Greek and Roman societies from ancient evidence, and will be able to discuss how the examination of a variety of genres and media (poetry, letters, biographies, histories, inscriptions, coins, works of art and architecture, etc.) can contribute to our understanding of these civilizations. There will also be a brief introduction to the reception of classical culture in later Western societies, and how classical texts and artefacts have been preserved and transmitted across the centuries. 

Participation in class is crucial; in one project, for example, you will re-enact the debate between the Melians and the Athenians concerning the fate of Melos during the Peloponnesian War. For your text/object analysis paper, you have the option of selecting an ancient object at the [Royal Ontario Museum](http://www.rom.on.ca/). The instructor will offer an optional tour of the Greek and Roman collections at the [ROM](http://www.rom.on.ca/) to help you select an object for your discussion.

## Introductory Latin II

### [Syllabus](/pdfs/lat102-intro-to-latin-ii.pdf) | University of Toronto, Winter 2015

This course forms the second half of an intensive introduction to Classical Latin, in which you will continue to develop and master a foundational knowledge of Latin grammar, syntax, and vocabulary, as well as your ability to translate short seen and unseen passages of prose from Latin to English, and vice versa.

## Introduction to Classical Mythology

### [Syllabus](/pdfs/cla204-intro-to-classical-myth.pdf) | University of Toronto, Summer 2014

This course will provide you with an introduction to the most important myths from the ancient Greek and Roman civilizations. We will focus especially on myths in action: how myths were transmitted, performed, and changed over time, and the role that these myths played in shaping the societies that had created and adapted them. There will also be an introduction to the reception of Classical myths in later Western cultures. All course readings come directly from translations of ancient texts and will be available online through our Perseids website. We will also examine myths narrated through other media, such as vase paintings, sculptures, frescoes, etc. For your last assignment, you have the option of comparing an ancient object at the [Royal Ontario Museum](http://www.rom.on.ca/) to a literary version of a myth from your assigned readings. The instructor will offer an optional tour of the Greek and Roman collections at the ROM to help you select an object for your discussion.
