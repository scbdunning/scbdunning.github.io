I am a Visiting Assistant Professor in the [Department of Classics](http://classics.chass.utoronto.ca/) at the [University of Toronto](http://www.utoronto.ca/) and a historian of Roman religion. You can write to me at <s.bilynskyj@utoronto.ca>.

My [dissertation](research/), *Roman Ludi Saeculares from the Republic to Empire,* is a history of the *Ludi Saeculares* (or "Saecular Games") from their mythic founding in the sixth century BCE until their final celebration in 248 CE. My other research interests include human associations with divinity in Plautine comedy and funerary monuments, Roman and Greek hymns, and Latin epigraphy.

I [teach](teaching/) Roman and Greek history and religion, Latin and Greek languages, and Classical myth and drama.
