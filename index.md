I am a PhD Candidate in the [Department of Classics](http://classics.chass.utoronto.ca/) at the [University of Toronto](http://www.utoronto.ca/) and a historian of Roman religion. You can write to me at <s.bilynskyj@utoronto.ca>.

My [dissertation](research/), *Roman Ludi Saeculares from the Republic to Empire,* is a history of the *Ludi Saeculares* or Secular Games from their mythic founding in the sixth century BCE until their final celebration in 248 CE. My other research interests include Roman and Greek hymns, human associations with divinity in Plautine comedy, and Latin epigraphy.

I [teach](teaching/) introductory Latin and Greek, Roman history, and classical mythology.
