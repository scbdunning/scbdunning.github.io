I am a Junior Research Fellow at [Somerville College, Oxford](https://www.some.ox.ac.uk/) and a SSHRC Postdoctoral Fellow with the [Faculty of Classics](https://www.classics.ox.ac.uk/). My research focus is on Roman history and religion. You can write to me at <susan.dunning@classics.ox.ac.uk>.

My forthcoming [monograph](research/), *The* Ludi Saeculares *and the* Saeculum: *Time, Festival, and Authority in the Roman World,* examines the development of the Saecular Games and their relationship to Roman conceptions of time from the Republic to late Empire. My [current research project](research/), *Humans as Gods in the Roman World*, is funded by Canada's [Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC)](http://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/home-accueil-eng.aspx) and the [Gerda Henkel Stiftung](https://www.gerda-henkel-stiftung.de/). I am investigating human associations with divinity in Plautus's comedies, Pompeiian graffiti, and in funerary monuments and inscriptions of the imperial period, and will publish my findings as a monograph. My other research interests include Roman and Greek hymns and Latin epigraphy.

My [ORCID profile](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9733-9403) provides links to my published works.

I am keen to contribute to public engagement and outreach. Some of my recent popular outputs include a teaching video on belief in Roman religion for Gerda Henkel's [L.I.S.A. Science Portal](https://lisa.gerda-henkel-stiftung.de/did_the_romans_believe_in_their_gods?nav_id=9347), an article on political 'time rhetoric' for the [Conversation](https://theconversation.com/has-boris-johnson-been-picking-up-tips-from-the-roman-emperors-131535), and a blog post on deification and the 'male gaze' for [Somerville College](https://www.some.ox.ac.uk/news/power-in-the-eye-of-the-beholder-the-male-gaze-and-roman-religion/). 

I [teach](teaching/) Roman and Greek history and religion, Latin and Greek languages at all levels, and Classical myth and drama.
