I am a Visiting Fellow with the [Institute of Classical Studies](https://ics.sas.ac.uk/) at the [School of Advanced Study, University of London](https://www.sas.ac.uk/) and a historian of Roman religion. You can write to me at <s.bilynskyj@utoronto.ca>.

My [monograph](research/), *The Ludi Saeculares and the Saeculum,* examines the development of the Saecular Games and their relationship to Roman conceptions of time from the Republic to late Empire. My other research interests include human associations with divinity in Plautine comedy and funerary monuments, Roman and Greek hymns, and Latin epigraphy.

I [teach](teaching/) Roman and Greek history and religion, Latin and Greek languages, and Classical myth and drama.
